      <h1>About Me:</h1><br> 
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>&emsp;Welcome visitors! My name is Khai Sam, a student from Pasadena High School. I may be a straight A student and an above average member of the APP Academy pathway, but I am, above all, a person who was influenced by his mentors and friends. Here, in the locus of my work, I desire to offer some recognition for these specific indiviuals: Mr.Taylor, Ms. Squires, Ms. Johnson, and Ms. Boyles. For me, they made coding a joy. From them, I learned RobotC, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They made these creations possible.</p><br>
        <p>&emsp;Although I am a diligent person, I, too, need motivation. Hence, I wish to recognize Alexander Flores, Liam Dimas, Idris Smith, Max Sami, and Mia Meyers as my rivals on this path. To ensure their privacies and securities, images will not be posted here. As a person, I enjoy a good laugh and seek purpose. I found it. I hope you do too!</p><br><br>

      <h1>The Purpose:</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;The Portfolio is created to house my creations between the year 2016 to 2020. They are separated into three categories: project, codePen, and p5 sketches. Each one represents the medium from which it was produced. The projects are organized chronologically by publish date not revision date, so it is possible for one to be unnaturally superior to others in the proximity.</p><br><br>
      <p>&emsp;You are welcome to examine and copy the code if you desire to, but don't forget to exercise proper citations! Plagiarizing is a heavy crime. I will suggest that you only copy the code that you understand; otherwise, it may have portentous side effects.</p><br><br><br>

            <p>Mission: Defense is a projectile-based game made in 11th grade. The idea was inspired from lessons gleaned in physic class.
