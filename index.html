        <h1>The Purpose:</h1><br>
        <p>&emsp;Hello future selves and passionated strangers. Since you are here, it must be time to unravel the fog of the future. No longer shall we we trudge along blindly. We will pave our own paths and follow through. It is time to fill our shopping cart. The Khai's Portfolio!</p><br><br>
        <p>&emsp;Here, we will decide how we want to live and the kind of jobs that we want to have. Even more immediately, we will decide what to do exactly after we graduate. While some prefer to advance their education, other may actually prefer to delve straight to work or attend the military. The future is just a maze of possibility. There will be dead ends and feel-good choices. However, I have the string and now it will be bestowed upon you.</p><br><br>
        <p>&emsp;One can think of these webpages as merely a poor-man life planner, but they are something more. These webpages are the culimination of everything I learned in two years at APP academy and it had been two long years. Javascript, CSS, HTML. You will experience my mastery these programming languages!</p><br><br>
        <p>&emsp;Whenever you are ready, advance the navigation bar. Your next location will be the College Session. Sure, there is limited options, but we can improvise. Once you are done, click "CheckOut".</p><br><br>
        <p>Ah yes, if you ever wonder about the grading for this project, here is the link to the requirements. Give it a read and then be the judge. The more opinions I received, the more these pages would improve. Wouldn't it? <a href="Rubric.html" id="rubricLink" target="_blank">Rubric</a> here.</p><br><br>
        <h1>About Me:</h1><br> 
        <p>&emsp;Such bad manner from me! I haven't properly introduce myself yet. My name is Khai Sam and I came from Vietnam during second grade's summer. From there, I learned English and gained fluency, though you are likely find many grammar errors embedded here. For my hobbies, I like to play video games and/or read books. The one game that made me fall in love was Pokemon White. It was literally my entire childhood until 5th grade. I just love the ingenuity behind the concept of catching 'em all. I think that was how I really got into programming. That and Robotic Competitions our class used to have in Wilson Middle School. Now, I am a a student at Pasadena High School learning how to program websites such as this one.</p><br><br>
        <p>&emsp;If only I had create a textbox, maybe we could have a full blown conversation. But alas, that will be too much work for such a lazy sophomore as I. Furthermore, it will distract you from utilizing these webpages. Wait a minute. On that thought, you shouldn't be wasting time on this!</p><br><br>
